# QAdwaitaDecorations
Qt decoration plugin implementing Adwaita-like client-side decorations.

## How to compile
This library uses private Qt headers and will likely not be forward nor
backward compatible. This library will have to be recompiled with every
Qt update. While it can be build using Qt 5, it is recommended to get
backported changes from Qt 6. You can get these [here](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/qt5-qtwayland/blob/rawhide/f/qtwayland-decoration-support-backports-from-qt6.patch).

Build instructions:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake [OPTIONS] [-DUSE_QT6=true] [-HAS_QT6_SUPPORT] ..
make && make install
```

## Usage
It can be used by setting the QT_WAYLAND_DECORATION environment variable:

```
export QT_WAYLAND_DECORATION=adwaita
```

From Qt 6.10.0, an implementation of this plugin was merged upstream. To force decorations from this plugin, set the QT_WAYLAND_DECORATION environment variable to the following value:
```
export QT_WAYLAND_DECORATION=adwaita_new
```
